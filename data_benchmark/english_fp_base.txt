Uh but like social media is covered in protest stuff just because you have a lot of people like going there and stuff #
Uh but everybody had a mask # you see hasn't seen any increase #
Um just because it comes with a whole bunch of new people who # I don't know what their lifestyle was like during all this time #
Um Nothing I mean he he will not leave his house at all and then with me he's like I'm living vicariously through you #

Uh Or you could take the bus # There is an extremely good not to bust the the metro rail system # I don't know what it's called #
Where in your # I think something # I know what you're talking about but they have such good public like um transportation in europe too #
Mhm # I don't know # I don't think uh Yeah I think we're on time already actually #
Doing # Pretty pretty excellent # The excellent it's uh 9 #00 here in Pacific Pacific coast time in Washington # Ah #
Um I mean actually uh university place yeah there you go #
Oh um I'm not quite sure # I'm in the east like the southeast part of Washington state #
So um like there's the tri cities area that's richland kennewick Pasco #
Yeah # Um I want to say about an hour or two #
Uh Well florida interesting state #
Um well actually decided to come to the west coast about your maybe two years ago actually when I visited #

Uh Yeah # Yeah # Okay # That's way colder than we get #
Huh # But um right flu shot #
An economy was you know like uh it got booming once he became president and then outside of that # I mean he's tried certain things #
Um I was doing a mechanical engineering internship # I was going to design brake parts for cars cancel #
Mhm # Mhm # Yeah # Yeah # I mean um you mean about the community #
Certain your um So are you like a senior # your graduate student #
Can you repeat that # Oh # uh so I'm going into my senior year # I originally was admitted into Mathematics and computer science #
Um Honestly at this point I have no idea what the goal honestly is to be a forest ranger #
But uh I gotta make before I do that #
Yeah # Sounds sweet # Did you do boy scouts or anything like what uh profitable #
Um So I was actually in Spain this semester #
Um And then so we got home from Spain and then like they transferred some of it on # this wasn't mandatory and none of that stuff #
Mm # Um No # Yeah so I was in Madrid # you just had a study abroad program #
They communicate every day from like the suburbs in um It was it was such a good time #
Um Which honestly was kind of strategy I didn't expect #
And then uh they give you bus passes which I didn't # I used a buck or two times # but the buses were apparently good #
Some queen # Um anyway we went there and nothing was open #
And then on I went to uh the museums and they have security there just smoking a cigarette #
People that uh yeah # that's wild #
Um And the cops honestly don't care nothing because there's just so many people it's not worth it #
Hopefully they kind of uh relax with the policies that they have now because it costs like hundreds of thousands of dollars to get a dispensary open #
Uh I have no clue #
Um Did you ask #

Oh nice # Did you go to like uh like CIA or anything like that or #
Um and that was during college now he's uh doing accounting for like a logging company and uh Tacoma Washington #
Yeah # Yeah so as far as like you're how you're managing um like it on unemployment # are you like doing anything like #
Right # Right # Yeah # I've heard her to claim that it's uh it's been a nightmare for a lot of people #
Oh and so now he's um doing delivery driving for papa john's #
Okay # Uh wow # wow #
Um it's kind of a potentially volatile situation um even though they were probably customers before and stuff like that #
It's uh kind of because #
Um If you're like just you know courteous # but it's just like # so I initially right # I didn't have a mask #
I like I have type of Oakland and uh what they from what I've read from some like scientific journals and everything #
But that uh Yes #
Um I probably stumbled across a few things because like uh me and my wife bought a house recently like last year #
Um But if you have kids # you really kind of have no choice # right # Because you need some stability for them # right #
But um yeah # that's the general rule of thumb #
Yeah # Exactly # Yeah # Yeah # Well see actually um I always I hate subscriptions #
But the exception is this really rural places where you can't get a can't get like um any kind of cabling out there #
Like # but obviously I've gained this knowledge through quite a while # Um I could probably teach some homeless people how to get by #
Yeah # Oh okay # Yeah # Uh That's true #
Um Different # Okay #
Uh I yeah # for like 10 years now and then uh okay #
Mhm # Mhm # Uh No # I'm about to start college # Yeah #
Uh I started like middle of some irish # so like maybe one month or like 1 #5 months # something like that #
Uh So even report the strategy and the U # S #
Um I live in New York City # how about you #
Oh okay # Uh we're in fun #
Um well I teach high school um which people always seem surprised #
So they feel like kids # the ones english is your second language # like they're just getting totally screwed over # Um I know #
So um how are you finding materials to teach one #
Um so nine background with like pot For 11 years # but special at elementary um in Kindergarten for a lot of it #
We're technically hybrid um where the students can choose if they want to be remote or virtual #
But there now the uh oh now that's what I think really happened to me #
Uh it's so surreal to think about # I don't know #
Uh Yeah # the good thing was I had # well I met I had all my classes meet at least once before I got sick # right #
Maybe I can go to work today # Uh Better not #
Yeah # Uh and the worst part is # it was one of those things where # so I go to college # like near where I live #
Uh Computer science and accountant #
Yeah # Uh so miserable # The # like # the brunt of what I've been doing is just having conversations with my Alexa on the table #
Um # american and Japan Airlines #
Hi um I'm Angelina # What is your name #
I'm talking about # Yeah # So uh are you going like are you doing like remote once the or right now #
Yes # When did you start doing um these studies online #

Yeah # Yeah # That is um Mhm #
Uh I've been to Orlando before #
If yeah # but that was like 11 of uh like like I stayed like in the hostage #
Uh But the problem with the job is they're not going to give you time #
Yeah # Really # Yeah # Oh yeah that'd be cool but I think um two apartments are really expensive here like in Manhattan #
Yeah # Um I think just don't fuck # Yeah #
Yeah # Mhm # Yeah # Oh # so um so so as a mechanical engineer # what do you do mostly #
Okay # Yeah # Yeah # Um Yeah # that's true # That makes sense #
Yeah # Um I think I think we're always supposed to talk for like 20 minutes # 25 minutes #
And kids with psychiatric um problems or #
That's how it is # When you have kids in a uh Yeah #
Uh You got to make choices # Your decision for yourself # Right # You gotta do what you think is # Right # So everybody #
Yeah # And Um about three or 4 years #
Uh That's that's all my wife like it's gas money # I don't want to hear it #
I kind of like um like if I want to buy something on amazon # I use the survey money so #
Um I don't know # Trying to think of what else to talk about #
And then uh so when I moved to Georgia I'll be living in um it's like subsidized housing for seniors #
