You really should # It's it's really nice # Yeah #
Is that a current ballot proposition # Like maybe I was one in the past # Uh Yes # thank you #

Franchise taxes are nuts # but it is what it is # Mhm #
Let's just say how do you like being an accountant #

Uh huh # I mean they are pretty related though #
Um I mean like if you're going to business I mean you do need math for it even if you come out an accountant #
Yeah # Yeah # Yeah #
Um And also political # you know political process #
I mean the amount of regulation and laws they have to comply with at all times # It's good to have a notion of how those happen #
Yeah # no definitely #
Um You know # just as a practical matter # Oh okay #
Right # It's not a sign # It's um they're not really definite answers #

It's more like wishy washy basically #
We don't know what the answer might just make up some random bullshit #
And basically uh which that's law school # which uh Yeah #

It was getting overwhelming #
So I'm glad that's done #
Yeah # Yeah I'm curious to see what they're gonna do for the school year #
Um Because I certainly don't think that they should advance the kids right #
I mean um at least here in Houston I don't feel like they had a school year at all #
Yeah # Yeah # Uh huh #
I mean but I guess everybody's kind of dealing with that #
So I'm not I'm curious as to I don't think that they're going to go back to school in august #

You know it's it's like mm yeah I'm like wow okay # this is very interesting #
It's surprising they give out money for the # some of these things that they do # Yeah # that's fine #

Yeah # Uh huh #
I mean # unless you have a death wish # I guess # I don't know #
No # I I really appreciate you saying that #
It's just it's so admirable #
Right # Do you do you think that it's worth having people stay in even though it is affecting our economy #
Mhm # Yeah # Not really # I am so # I am so torn on that #
Right # Right # Right # Right #
But there hasn't been proof that that's true #
Yeah # that's true #
Mhm # Mhm # Mhm # Mhm #
Yeah # Yeah # mm hmm # we really want to take that # right #
Um So # you know # I can trust that at the same time # like there's just so much uncertainty around that #
Yeah # there is # as my husband keeps saying # he's like # well # you know # he's like think of it like chicken pox #
And I can I can spare them from this paint # Yes # absolutely #
I mean # even with all this movement # you know # we've been staying home #

I've had my old boss when I worked at a gelato store #
And then of course they came out and the bugs that whole # it's linked to autism # And I'm like # yes # I was right #
It is # there is no link # So that was always it's good #
Then he started showing tons of really bad autism after that #
Right # I just care # So is there like a correlation between that like if you know like showed proof that the vaccine caused it #
Mhm # Yeah # sure #
I'm just interested # Yeah #
Yeah # Mhm mm hmm # Oh yeah #

That's such an interesting conversation to have # So you're in central time # what part of the country #
Yeah # I'm in texas #
And let's say you're in texas # Okay # that's a Wild West #
So so how are the regulations for how you guys are doing stuff #
Okay # Sure # Mhm #
Uh No that's his his uh his his name is # Kevin McCarthy # his name #
New Orleans # No # no # not the minority leader # Okay #
Yes # Oh good # good # Mhm # It's so interesting #
I think in California most your schools are online # Right #
Most are either online or doing some kind of very strict hybrid thing # I know in L #
A # County for sure # It's just remote only # Um It's interesting # what's your hypothesis #
What are you saying for the next month # Are you saying they're gonna loosen restrictions # Are they gonna tighten them up # Do you think #
Oh I expect we'll be all online in four weeks # I'm not sure #
Really # you're pretty sure about that #
But like a lot of colleges are going that way like after even a week # so #
So you say # you know what grade do you teach #
What were your parents I teach at the college level #
Yeah # So there's it's like incentive um to get students on campus and get them to pay their tuition and stuff #
Yeah # Mhm # Right #
Right # It's tough with the younger kids because a lot of a lot of families like it's their only daycare when I go up to work #
So we'll see # okay # we've got a pretty we've got a pretty short memory attention span in our current time #
Let's see how it translates to the vote # Okay #
So I feel like once it's done done # people just can't forget about it # you know #
Yeah # Yeah # Yeah # Maybe # I don't know if this one seems so memorable that I have a hard time believing that but #
I think that I think that it's going to fall by the wayside by the end of next year #
What is it # Yeah #
Like other countries # like the asian countries often do #
Mhm # People are getting used to that # right #
I don't know # I live in an area # I'm sure you've heard of it # Bakersfield # Yeah # just a horrible horrible service #
Yeah # You don't # yeah #
Um And and it's a big oil part of the state and the air pollution out here is just ridiculous #
Oh # really # Sure #
Hmm # You seem like it's a big oil producing area #
But it's a massive oil producing area and that's why it has in my interpretation of weeks #
Mm # Well # yeah # I was gonna say like here in texas were also huge oil state #
Yeah # Mhm # Yeah # Yeah #
Yeah of course not # Regulations makes it harder to do business # Yeah #
Right # Yeah # And I mean in texas # a lot of the oil production is tracking so yeah #
Which is why I hear is the most environmentally sustainable form of oil # Uh What is it # what's the word for that #
Mhm # I don't know # extraction or something # Yeah #
Right # Yeah # Especially easy in 2020 # right # Anyway # Right # Okay # Okay # Well # what are your hobbies before Covid #

Yeah # I'd assumed that uh Yeah # yeah um I'm from Spokane # which is just on the other side of the state #
Mm Are you originally from Seattle #
Mhm # Yeah # Mhm Yeah # I mean there's so much rain right that guys #

Yeah # stop # stop putting out fires #
No one has been like protests at the fire stations like # yeah # Oh yeah #

Oh gosh # Yeah # No # it's been # it's been all right # It's just been a weird year # Like all this covid stuff #
Mhm Uh huh Mhm Mhm Yeah # it's no # it's been crazy #
I um my boyfriend and I were going to go down to California #
Oh gosh # Yeah # That would suck #
Mhm # So I'm gonna very yeah # it's so expensive #
Uh Fair enough here # mm that's true # yeah # that's gonna be # that's gonna be pricey right there #
Yeah # I was right in the heart of it so I was like yeah #
Yeah # no # I'm not a fan #
Oh yeah # it was very expensive # Yeah #
I originally # so from in hawaii the cost of everything # the cost of living in general is just ridiculously high #
It's like 1500 minimum # you know #
Yeah # Seriously # Like gone Kokoschka #
Yeah # Mm hmm # Yeah # Mhm #
It was just so expensive like #
Yeah # Yeah # Uh huh # Yeah #
Yeah # Oh God #
Yeah # It still feels a little better # Yeah # I'm in a partner # Yeah # The theory of everything #
Mhm # Uh huh mhm # It's like one animal at night mm That's going to be so peaceful though #
Yeah # Yeah # Mhm #
Is it are you able to go outside and do hikes and things right now or is it too rainy #
But wasn't explored the actual Olympia area and got a like it was like nighttime in the capitol buildings all lit up #
Oh that'll be really magazine #
It's like on the big hill overlooking the lake and stuff like #
It's a cool capital #
It was like really nice #
And it's like the coolest farmers market I've ever been to #
Good to know what part of the landscape #
Yeah like it's just like if you're not wearing plaid a few days a week then what are you even doing #
That's incredibly accurate do you think #
Like what did you go to school for you #
Yeah # Oh that's so crazy # This is well that's weird because I've done three of these like survey chat things now #
Whenever I drop that # do what people are like # that's interesting # What are you gonna do with that #
And the first dude uh played piano and guitar like and then the second it was a music teacher at a school #
Oh crap # Uh huh # I don't have any music #
Yeah # but it makes sense right # All the # all the broke music people for employment outcomes # it has the exact same #
Yeah I'm just broke and not talented so it's kind of like a that's fine #
it's the exact same yeah mm where you were you sending that #
Um I've just been doing like self paced online stuff # I'm going to finish my degree out through W # G # U # Which is online #
It's Western Governors University #
So um it's nice because it's like competency based # You just test out on every class whenever you feel ready for it #
Yeah # Especially dealing with like 18 year olds in your same class #
Okay # Yeah # I can't imagine #
I've never lived away from home # Yeah #
Like # I don't know #
Mhm # Yeah # I mean there's some really mature youth # young people # but no # no # no # I know #
Not yet # Yeah #
Uh I would like to eventually work for like a nonprofit of some kind #
Mhm Yeah # especially if you're from # I mean if you're from Washington you have the connections #
I don't know doing what exactly # But I mean every company needs coders of some kind so that's really Oh yeah #
Mhm # Mhm # 100 respect # Well not even # well not anymore # but I used to go to like coding meetups and stuff #
But yeah # it's really about networking but it's not easy to network right now so Yeah # unfortunately #
And yeah # Gosh # that sucks # Yeah # What law school are you trying to go to or want to #
Oh yeah # Yeah #
So like the top three schools #
And um Yeah # Yeah # Mhm #
Holy crap # Yeah #
Yeah # That's that's ridiculous # Our whole education system in America is backwards #
Yeah # So I think you're definitely doing the right thing #
Like you found you found the like way to thread the needle with that #
Yeah # Oh yeah # it's so much cheaper #
Number # That's amazing #
Mhm # Yeah # Mhm # No # that makes total sense #
It's I mean just the like the employability matrix # right versus debt #
Oh right now I want to move to new Zealand but travel around # I want to go to like Portugal Morocco #
I haven't gone anywhere # So basically the whole world # But those are my like I really want to Scandinavia #
Any of the like pretty much all those #
Yeah # I don't know how you travel much #
A fair amount # but not to any of those places # Um More to I I was abroad in Singapore for a term and then I Singapore #
Okay # One thing if you ever get over to Asia # it's um it's super expensive to get there #
Which sucks # But once you're there the there's so many budget airlines #
Oh yes # Yeah #
Oh my God # that's amazing #
Mhm # Yeah # Yeah # Yeah #
Yeah # yeah # yeah #
I can deal with in this Scandinavia #
Oh wow # that's really cool #
And her being like # oh I'm conservative for thinking this is like what #
Mhm # Yeah # Right #
Yeah # mm Have you # have you visited traveled around the US at all #
Otherwise I've just been like California Oregon # Washington # British Columbia bit #
But like I never left the West # I literally didn't leave the time zone until I was 29 #
Mhm Yeah Right # Uh huh # mhm #
I'm like # I just feel like I'm still kind of in that vibe #
Mhm Right # Yeah # Yes # Really #
I'm like # I was like # what the f is that is the biggest rat I've ever seen #
He's cracking up like # oh God # you're not going to last year #
Yeah # I know that there's not over there #
You know # you have come down in Oregon #
I just think they're hilarious to see because it's like literally just like an overgrown worse rat #
Uh huh # Yeah #
Uh huh # Mhm #
Always hear raccoons everywhere # Like so many raccoons #
Oh that's so funny # Please our human gods give us a chino #
There's like just really sad because if people aren't going there then they're probably like not knowing how to hunt for food themselves #
Uh huh # Yeah #
So that's why we lost was a feeding and most of it #
I think I I don't know #
Oh man # Yeah #
And so anything bigger than that is just shocking to me # It's like the concept of they're just being raccoons # like huge things just wandering around #
Yeah # that makes sense #
Yeah # Not not a skunk # I've seen a porcupine in like a zoo # but not not in real life #
Uh huh # Yeah # I see him in the wild quite often and beer all the time #
Do you have deer in Hawaii #
We do actually # So those are not as exciting to me #
They don't # they don't make the cut #
Mhm # Not and moose like those can really mess you up #
Mhm # Have you seen 1 #
Yeah # they're huge #
Like a gigantic It's terrifying #
Yeah # I think so #
Is that the one where he encounters a moose # Yeah #
I I was in fifth grade # I don't remember # but like Uh huh #
Yeah # no 100 #. Gosh #
People luckily the black bears are the most common # it seems like # and they tend to not mess with people #
Okay # Yeah # I've heard that they're they're like pretty easy to scare off #
Mhm # Yeah # there are a lot of attended #
So it like # was just wandering the streets # but we stayed inside until a peace out #
Yeah # Uh huh #
I think someone has called animal control yourself then just attracted away #
But luckily if they're not next to like # they're young # they aren't as bad #
It's like when you get between like the baby and the mother # that's when they're like # hell now that we're yeah # you're a danger #
And yeah # seriously # it's terrifying #
Mhm # mm hmm #
Uh huh # Let's go # Let's go on a date to buy bear spray #
